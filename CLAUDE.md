# Git Flow

- `main` → stable, production-ready (deployed to GitHub Pages), always tagged with `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `dev` → integration branch, base for all feature branches
- `feature/*` → one feature per branch, always from `dev`
- `hotfix/*` → urgent fix from `main`, merged back to both `main` and `dev`

In this project, a version tag represents a finalized version of the CV content (e.g. the version sent out for a job application), not a software release in the traditional sense.

### Branch rules
- Never push directly to `main`
- `feature/*` → merged directly into `dev`, no PR required
- `hotfix/*` → PR to `main`, then sync to `dev`
- `dev` → PR to `main` only when stable (triggers a version tag)
- Every merge into `dev` or `main` uses a merge commit (`git merge --no-ff`), never a fast-forward

### Versioning (Semantic Versioning)
- `v1.0.0` → MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- PATCH → hotfix (typo, small wording/layout fix)
- MINOR → new feature (new experience/project entry, new section, new capability)
- MAJOR → breaking change (full CV rewrite, major redesign)

### Workflow
- New feature : `git checkout -b feature/xxx dev`
- Hotfix      : `git checkout -b hotfix/xxx main`
- Merge       : `git checkout dev && git merge --no-ff feature/xxx`
- Release     : PR from `dev` to `main` + tag `vX.X.X` after merge

## Git Workflow

### Before creating a new feature branch
1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git checkout dev && git merge --ff-only origin/dev`
3. `git checkout -b feature/xxx`

### Before creating a hotfix branch
1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only origin/main`
3. `git checkout -b hotfix/xxx`

### Before opening a PR, or if the branch is behind its base
1. `git stash` local WIP changes
2. `git rebase -i origin/<base>` — create atomic commits following Conventional Commits
3. `git rebase origin/<base>` (never merge)
4. `git push --force-with-lease`
5. `git stash pop` after switching branches

### Commit conventions (Conventional Commits)
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `chore:` maintenance task
- `docs:` documentation
- `refactor:` code restructuring

### Rules
- Never open a PR with WIP or non-atomic commits
- Never use merge to catch up with the base branch, always rebase
- Never force push without `--force-with-lease`
