# Interactive Resume Template

An open-source interactive resume template. Clone it, fill in your info, deploy it.

Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

> Based on [Clément Bouly's Interactive Resume Template](https://github.com/clementbouly/interactive-resume-template) — this repository is a personal fork used to deploy [cv.vincentboutin.dev](https://cv.vincentboutin.dev/). All credit for the original design and template goes to the original author.

## Not a developer? No problem!

## Development with AI agents

This project includes [Agentation](https://agentation.dev/) — a visual feedback toolbar for AI coding agents. When running in development mode (`npm run dev`), a small toolbar appears at the bottom-right of the page.

It lets you click on any element, select text, or annotate parts of your resume, then copy a structured description to your clipboard. Paste it directly into your AI agent's chat to give it precise context about what you want changed.

Agentation is **only active in development** and is automatically stripped from production builds.

> See the [Agentation documentation](https://agentation.dev/features) for more details.

## ATS & SEO

**"Is it ATS-compatible?"** — ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) today primarily parse PDF and DOCX files. This interactive resume is designed as a **complement** to your PDF, not a replacement.

However, the template does everything possible to make your CV readable by bots and crawlers **without JavaScript**:

- **Build-time SEO injection** — A custom Vite plugin reads your config at build time and injects all data directly into the static HTML. Crawlers see the full CV, not an empty `<div id="root">`
- **JSON-LD structured data** — Your name, job title, skills, and links are embedded as [schema.org/Person](https://schema.org/Person) metadata in the `<head>`, readable by search engines and modern parsers
- **`<noscript>` semantic HTML** — The complete CV (contact, skills, experiences with tasks, education, projects, hobbies) is rendered as clean HTML inside `<noscript>`, so non-JS visitors and bots see everything
- **Static meta tags** — `<title>` and `<meta description>` are set from your config at build time
- **Shareable URL** — Send `?lang=en` directly to recruiters for the right language
- **PDF download** — Per-language PDF files for traditional ATS submissions

**Recommended workflow:** Apply with your PDF, and add the interactive link in your email or LinkedIn message.
